    <p>I would love to play cricket and explore places on a vacation. Listening songs would be a stress free to me.</p>

    <h2>Chicken Biryani</h2>
    <p>Chicken biryani is known for its rich and aromatic flavors. It combines tender chicken pieces with fragrant basmati rice and a blend of spices, such as cumin, coriander, cardamom, and cinnamon. Chicken biryani is a favorite for me because of its incredible taste, versatility, cultural significance.</p>
